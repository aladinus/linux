ssh keys - using keys to authenticated instead of password, much secure
  private key
  public key
  
to create ssh keys: 
  $ ssh-keygen

typically, it will be stored in /home/aladinux/.ssh/ but you can change it
  id_rsa - private key
  id_rsa - public key

.ssh files
  authorized_keys - contains the public keys of users that are allowed to ssh login
  known_hosts - contains identity of devices that was previously connected
  config - 


ssh key forwarding - will forward your private key on the machine that you will ssh login into then you can use your private keys to ssh login to another machine
  1. create ~/.ssh/config
  2. input the host address that you want to allow to forward your key. * can be used to define all address
      Host [host address]
        ForwardAgent yes
  3. set the environment variables that need to be set for agent forwarding
      eval "$(ssh-agent)"
  4. add the key you want forwarded to the ssh agent
      ssh-add [path]/[key_name]
  5. log in to the remote host
      ssh -A [user]@[hostname]
  6. from here, if you log into another host that accepts that key, it will work
      ssh [user]@[hostname]
